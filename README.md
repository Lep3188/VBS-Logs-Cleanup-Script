# VBS-Logs-Cleanup-Script

## This script was made for cleaning folders with thousands of files generated by servers. I recommend that a task is created in task scheduler. 

## **How it works:**
### Basiscally the script gets information from a config file in xml format, from that file the script gets the following information:
#### 1. Path to the folder where the files to be deleted are stored. 
#### 2. If subfolders also required cleanup (True or False)
#### 3. Age of file, this the ammount of days old a file needs to be to qualify for deletion. (If value is 5 then files that are 5 days or older get deleted)
#### 4. File extension of the files that need to be deleted (make sure is uppser case)

### At the end of each node run, the script adds to a folder (bottom of the code) a text file with information of what was deleted. This is the way it was built for a specific company. I recommend that the log function gets deleted and configure it for sending the information through email instead (keep in mind that the log information the will need to be appended to a string variable or array)
